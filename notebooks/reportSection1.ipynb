    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "(maybe a better introduction)\n",
    "(Add the visualization software and team formation)\n",
    "(how the responders are given the task to create survey to find certain information about their class)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind the survey is to find out which is graph gives the most accuracy in a certain amount of time.\n",
    "To make questions, we followed the general structure provided by Dr.Bowen and the student(s) who worked on this project before us.\n",
    "\n",
    "General Structure:\n",
    "- Basic interpretability\n",
    "    - We asked a simple question to test if the responder understands the graph.\n",
    "- Moving individuals\n",
    "    - We provided a set of graphs which are suppose to be two teams (i.e Team A, Team B) and we asked responder to move a individuals from a team to other team depending on the question.\n",
    "- Comparing team sets\n",
    "    - Here we asked the responder to explore at two different scenarios (each scenario contained three different team) and provide a answer based on question. \n",
    "- General preference (rank viz choices)\n",
    "    - In the end, we asked the responder to give their preference on which graph is the best from them and asked for an explaination.\n",
    "    \n",
    "We followed this general structure and based on this, Dr.Bowen and us came up with different question in order to test responder's understanding for each graph. The graph were created using Python. We used Qualtrics as a data collection tool and analysis the data collected. The main goal of study is to improve the previous survey/study(?) by replacing the existing graphs with better graphs and improving questionnaires. In analysis section, we will try to find relationship between accuracy and time taken by the responders to complete the questionnaire.\n",

    "# The Questionnaire\n",
    "\n",
    "Up till now, we have made use of 5 different graphs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stack Bar Graph\n",
    "2. Group Bar Graph\n",
    "3. Grid View\n",
    "4. Heat Map\n",
    "5. Tally\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to pervious study, we decided to use stack bar graph and group bar graph to create team based on Student Skills.\n",
    "(reasoning left)\n",
    "\n",
    "The student skills are as follow: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Website: how good they are at designing websites\n",
    "- Database: how good they are at writing code for databases\n",
    "- Communication: good they are with talking to clients and customers\n",
    "- Time: how good they are with time management\n",
    "\n",
    "where the Students responded to each skill on a scale from 1 - 5, where 1 means they are bad at that skill, and 5 means they are very proficient at that skill.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid View, Heat Map and Tally were used to create team based on Time availability.\n",
    "(reasoning left)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implementing Counterbalancing\n",
    "\n",
    "As we were working to create the survey and we realized that the survey result might be unfair as we were asking for graphs in a specific order (i.e stack bar graph then group bar graph). As the graphs are different and have their drawbacks. We introduced counterbalancing to make our result fair. We used the Latin square technique for our study where we will **N** no. of the version of our survey for the **N** no. of graphs. For example, if the survey has two types of graphs then there will be two versions. The first version will have graph type 1 then graph type 2 and the second version will have graph type 2 then graph type 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "### For the Latin Square counterbalancing, we created two version of section 1 - Skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Version 1 had Group bar graph first then Stacked bar graph\n",
    "### The Version 2 had Stacked bar graph first then Group bar graph\n"
